# Hi {{user.firstName}},

you received this e-mail because the building permit regarding project {{operation}} at {{address}}, {{municipality}}, which you applied for in a paper format has now been changed into electronic form. This has been done so that you can easily edit your information at Lupapiste, for example by naming work supervisors, during the building process.

Lupapiste is an online service through which you can apply for all permits regarding built environments and take care of all issues whenever it suits you the best - even from your sofa at home.

You can see your permit by clicking the link below. If the link doesn't work, copy the address and paste it in your browser's address bar.

If you haven't used Lupapiste before with your e-mail address {{recipient-email}}, you need to first register as a Lupapiste user. The registration is done either with your online banking codes or with a mobile certificate.

Work supervisors must be invited to see both the building permit and his/her application/notification of a supervisory role from either a project member or a person authorized by him/her. The invitation is sent from Building tab of the building permit and it appears in the supervisor's e-mail inbox.

If you have previously named your supervisors regarding the permit in question, they are not visible at Lupapiste. Previously made supervisor notifications or applications don't need to be re-sent.


Kind regards,

{{lupapiste}}
