# Hi,

You have an expiring permit in Lupapiste {{link}}

Operation: {{operation}}

It seems that the construction has not been started yet.

If the work is not started in three (3) years after the permit is
issued, the permit is invalidated (MRL 143 ยง). If you are still
planning to finish your construction project, you must apply for an
extension. If the extension is not approved, you cannot start the
construction after three (3) years of the permit issue date. Please
contact the Building Control for more information.

Kind regards,
