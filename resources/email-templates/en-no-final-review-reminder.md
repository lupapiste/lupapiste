# Hi,

You have an expiring permit in Lupapiste {{link}}

Operation: {{operation}}

The permit is near expiring and it seems that the final inspection has
not been done.

Please contact the Building Control for reserving the inspection date.

In case the construction is still ongoing, you must request an
extension. If the work is not finished within five (5) years after the
starting date, the permit is invalidated (MRL 143 ยง).

Kind regards,
